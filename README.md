# Devstats data

Every week, we release a developer data snapshot for [Scientific Python](https://scientific-python.org) [core projects](https://scientific-python.org/specs/core-projects/).
These snapshots can be turned into HTML reports with the [devstats](https://github.com/scientific-python/devstats) tool.

Browse the snapshots under [releases](https://github.com/scientific-python/devstats-data/releases).
